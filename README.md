## IMAGE-BASED STEGANOGRAPHY USING ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION
This project emphasizes an image-based steganography system that makes use of the RSA algorithm for asymmetric encryption. The technique uses a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to hide encrypted data inside of visuals. The CNN model is used to embed the RSA-prepared encrypted data into the cover image. This allows for the extraction and decryption of the hidden data from a different image. With the use of asymmetric encryption algorithms, the system provides safe data concealment inside images for increased data security and secrecy
